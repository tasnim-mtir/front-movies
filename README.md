# movies-recommendation
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built with a Node.js backend using Axios to scrape data from the TMDb API and MongoDB for data storage. The frontend is developed using Angular, allowing users to input their preferences (such as genre, year, and language) to receive personalized movie recommendations.
